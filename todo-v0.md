- [x] transcript_controller.js (interactive transcript with highlights)
- [x] prompts_controller.js (prompt library and shuffle functionality)
- [x] insights_controller.js (trends and sparkline visualizations)

### ðŸ“„ Phase 7: Views & UI
- [x] sessions/index (session history with states)
- [x] sessions/new (recording interface with prompts)
- [x] sessions/show (player + transcript + metrics + issues)
- [x] prompts/index (categorized prompt library)
- [x] Application layout with navigation tabs
- [x] Responsive CSS (mobile-first, no framework)

### âœ… Phase 8: Language Rules Configuration (COMPLETED)
- [x] config/clarity/en.yml (English speech patterns)

- [x] Rule validation and testing utilities

- [x] Export functionality (JSON/transcript)
- [x] Session insights and trends (7-day sparklines)
- [x] Adaptive prompting based on user weaknesses
- [x] Privacy controls (auto-delete raw audio)
- [x] Accessibility enhancements (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### âœ… Phase 10: Testing & Quality (COMPLETED)
- [x] Model specs with proper factories (80 examples - all models tested)
- [x] Service specs for all analysis components (55 examples - core services covered)
- [x] Controller specs with integration tests (Request specs for all controllers)
- [x] System specs for full user flows (End-to-end testing for key workflows)
- [x] Performance testing for analysis pipeline (Comprehensive performance benchmarks)
- [x] Audio processing edge case testing (Edge cases and error handling)

### âœ… Phase 11: Production Readiness (COMPLETED)
- [x] Error monitoring and logging
- [x] Background job monitoring
- [x] API rate limiting and retry logic
- [x] File cleanup tasks (old recordings)
- [x] Performance optimization
- [x] Security review and hardening

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 12: Documentation & Deployment
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] User guide for recording best practices
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Notes

### SQLite Adaptations
Since we're using SQLite instead of PostgreSQL with pgvector:
- Store embeddings as JSON arrays in TEXT columns
- Implement cosine similarity calculations in Ruby
- Use JSON functions for querying embedded data
- Consider future migration path to PostgreSQL for scale

### AI Integration Strategy
- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Aggressive caching to minimize costs
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Clear separation between rule-based and AI analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Stream audio processing to avoid memory issues
- Lazy load large analysis results
- Background job processing for all heavy lifting
- Client-side constraints to prevent oversized uploads
