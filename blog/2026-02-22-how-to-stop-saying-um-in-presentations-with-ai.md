# How to Stop Saying "Um" in Presentations (Using AI Feedback)

Filler words kill credibility. Research from the University of Michigan shows speakers who use fewer fillers are rated 15–20% more competent and trustworthy by audiences.

The problem: you don't hear your own "ums." Your brain edits them out in real time. That's why willpower alone doesn't work.

This guide covers a practical system for eliminating filler words from presentations — using AI-powered feedback to surface what your ears miss.

## Why filler words persist (even when you know better)

Filler words are a speech disfluency — your brain's way of holding the conversational floor while it retrieves the next thought. They're not a sign of low intelligence. They're a sign of cognitive load.

Three main triggers:

- **Transitioning between ideas** — your outline is weak or you haven't internalized the flow
- **Searching for the precise word** — perfectionism in real time causes verbal stalling
- **Anxiety and self-monitoring** — the more you worry about fillers, the more you produce them

Understanding the trigger matters because each one has a different fix.

## The baseline problem: you can't fix what you can't measure

Most speakers underestimate their filler word count by 3–5x. Ask someone "how many ums did I use?" after a 5-minute talk, and they'll guess 3–4. The actual count is often 15–20.

This is why recording yourself matters — but raw recordings don't give you structured data. You'd need to replay, count manually, and track progress over time.

AI speaking coaches solve this by detecting and counting filler words automatically, then showing you patterns: where in your talk the fillers cluster, whether they increase over time, and which specific fillers you default to.

## A 14-day system to reduce filler words by 50%+

### Days 1–3: Establish your baseline

Record three 60-second sessions on different topics:
1. Describe your last vacation
2. Explain what you do for work
3. Summarize a recent article you read

Use an AI speaking coach like [AI Talk Coach](https://aitalkcoach.com) to get automatic filler word counts and positions. Write down your average per minute. This is your baseline.

### Days 4–7: The pause replacement drill

Every time you feel an "um" forming, replace it with a silent pause. This feels unnatural at first — your brain interprets silence as failure. It's not. Audiences perceive pauses as confidence.

Practice daily:
- Set a 90-second timer
- Speak on any topic
- Every time you catch a filler, stop. Breathe. Continue.
- Review the AI feedback after each session

Target: reduce filler count by 25% from baseline.

### Days 8–11: Structure-first speaking

Most fillers happen during transitions. Fix the transitions, fix the fillers.

Before each practice session, write three bullet points:
- Opening statement
- One supporting point
- Closing statement

Speak for 120 seconds using only those three bullets. The structure gives your brain a map, reducing the cognitive load that triggers fillers.

### Days 12–14: Pressure test

Increase difficulty:
- Speak for 3 minutes instead of 90 seconds
- Pick unfamiliar topics (explain quantum computing, summarize a book you read years ago)
- Record and review every session

By day 14, most speakers see a 40–60% reduction in filler words compared to their day-1 baseline.

## What AI feedback catches that you won't

A good AI speaking coach tracks more than just "um" and "uh":

- **"Like," "you know," "basically," "actually"** — stealth fillers that sound conversational but erode authority
- **Filler clustering** — three fillers in 10 seconds signals a structural problem, not a verbal habit
- **Pace-filler correlation** — many speakers speed up before a filler, then slow down after. The AI surfaces this pattern so you can address the pacing issue, not just the symptom
- **Progress over sessions** — seeing a chart of filler reduction over 14 days is the single strongest motivator for continued practice

## When fillers are actually fine

Not all fillers need elimination. Conversational settings (team meetings, 1:1s) tolerate more disfluency than formal presentations. The goal isn't zero — it's control.

If you're averaging fewer than 3 fillers per minute in casual speech, you're in a good range. For formal presentations, aim for under 1 per minute.

## FAQ

### How long does it take to stop saying um in presentations?
Most people see a 40–60% reduction in filler words within 14 days of structured practice with AI feedback. Complete elimination isn't the goal — control is. Aim for under 1 filler per minute in formal settings.

### Can an AI speaking coach really detect filler words accurately?
Yes. AI speaking coaches like AI Talk Coach use speech recognition models trained specifically on disfluency patterns. They detect not just "um" and "uh" but also stealth fillers like "basically," "actually," and "you know" — words most human listeners don't consciously track.

### Why do I say um even when I know I shouldn't?
Filler words are a neurological response to cognitive load — your brain holds the conversational floor while retrieving the next thought. They're not a character flaw. They're a pattern you can interrupt with structured practice and objective feedback on where they cluster in your speech.

### Is it better to practice speaking alone or with an audience?
Start alone. Practicing with an AI coach removes social pressure so you can focus purely on the mechanical habit of replacing fillers with pauses. Once your baseline drops, add audience pressure gradually — present to one person, then a small group.

### What's the difference between AI speaking feedback and recording myself?
Self-recording requires you to replay and manually count fillers — most people don't do this consistently. AI feedback is automatic, structured, and tracked over time. You get filler counts, pacing data, and progress charts without any manual effort.
