## Who Each App Is Really For

### AI Talk Coach — The Daily Habit Builder

AI Talk Coach was built around one belief: speaking is a skill, and skills grow with consistent daily practice.

Its micro-session format (30–180 seconds) is intentionally short. The goal isn't to simulate a full presentation — it's to build the habit of showing up every day. You record a quick session, get AI feedback on 7 metrics instantly, and see your progress compound over time.

**What makes it different:**
- **11-language support** — filler word detection in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Turkish. If you're not a native English speaker, this matters enormously.
- **Personalized pace targets** — you set your ideal WPM (60–240), and the AI calibrates to you, not some generic benchmark.
- **Privacy-first** — no account required to try it, and you can delete your sessions anytime.
- **Progress charts + streaks** — keeps you accountable without gamification gimmicks.

**Where it's honest about its limits:**
- No video analysis yet (body language, eye contact tracking are on the roadmap)
- Smaller user community than Orai or Speeko
- No human coach option

**Best for:** Busy professionals who want to build a daily speaking habit, non-English speakers, or anyone who wants to just start without friction.

---

### Orai — The Presentation Practitioner

Orai's tagline is "practice your presentations." That's exactly what it's for.

With 300,000+ users and 2 million+ speeches analyzed, Orai has scale and credibility. It's built specifically for people who need to prepare and deliver presentations — sales pitches, boardroom decks, speaking engagements.

**What makes it different:**
- Long-form speech practice (full presentations, not micro-sessions)
- Strong focus on delivery confidence and reducing public speaking fear
- Available on both iOS and Android (broader device reach)

**Where it falls short:**
- English-focused (limited multilingual support)
- No human coaching component
- The practice-a-presentation model assumes you already have something to present — not ideal for general skill-building

**Best for:** Professionals with a specific presentation coming up, or people who want to rehearse speeches and get delivery feedback.

---

### Speeko — The Structured Curriculum

Speeko is the most "app-as-a-course" of the three. It combines AI analysis with structured content from Roger Love (a well-known vocal coach), plus an option to book 1:1 sessions with a real coach.

With 400,000+ users and 3,500+ five-star reviews, it's clearly hitting a nerve. The "bite-sized exercises" approach (2 minutes a day) is similar in spirit to AI Talk Coach but packaged more as a learning curriculum.

**What makes it different:**
- Content from Roger Love — if you want celebrity-coach credibility, this is your app
- 1:1 human coaching option — the only one of the three that offers this
- Real-time tracking during calls and meetings (not just solo practice)

**Where it falls short:**
- iOS only (no Android, no web app)
- More expensive than alternatives if you want coaching
- English-focused — less useful for multilingual speakers

**Best for:** People who want a structured curriculum, aspire to 1:1 coaching, or specifically want to improve voice quality and tone (not just filler words and pace).

## Feature Deep-Dive

### Speech Metrics

What gets measured gets improved. Here's what each app tracks:

**AI Talk Coach (7 metrics):**
- Clarity score (0–100 composite)
- Filler words
- Speaking pace
- Fluency
- Engagement indicators
- Word choice analysis
- Overall composite score

**Orai:**
- Filler words
- Pace
- Energy/enthusiasm
- Conciseness
- Usage scores per practice session

**Speeko:**
- Pace (words per minute)
- Tone and pitch variety
- Filler words
- Hedging/qualifying language
- Emotional expression

All three track the fundamentals. AI Talk Coach provides the most metrics in a single view; Orai and Speeko offer more narrative/qualitative feedback alongside numbers.

---

### Multilingual Support

This is where the gap is significant.

**AI Talk Coach:** Filler word detection in 11 languages — English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Turkish. AI feedback generated for any language.

**Orai:** Primarily English. Limited non-English support.

**Speeko:** English only.

If you're a non-native English speaker, AI Talk Coach is the only meaningful option in this group.

---

### Session Length & Format

**AI Talk Coach:** 30–180 seconds. Intentionally short. Choose from 8 curated prompts or speak freely. Designed to fit in anywhere.

**Orai:** Full speech/presentation practice. Longer sessions, more like rehearsal than micro-practice.

**Speeko:** "2 minutes a day" structured exercises. Curated curriculum with specific topics and drills.

---

### Privacy

**AI Talk Coach:** No account required to try. Delete sessions anytime. Explicit privacy-first design.

**Orai:** Account required. Recording storage for analysis.

**Speeko:** Account required. Recordings used for AI analysis; privacy policy notes no third-party access.
