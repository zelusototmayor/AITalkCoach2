## 1. BASIC METRICS

**Location:** `app/services/analysis/metrics.rb` (lines 70-84)

These foundational metrics establish the baseline characteristics of each speech session:

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **word_count** | Total words spoken | count |
| **unique_word_count** | Vocabulary diversity | count |
| **duration_ms** | Total recording duration | milliseconds |
| **duration_seconds** | Recording duration | seconds |
| **speaking_time_ms** | Actual time spent speaking (excludes pauses) | milliseconds |
| **pause_time_ms** | Total silence/pause duration | milliseconds |
| **average_word_length** | Characters per word (word complexity) | characters |
| **syllable_count** | Estimated syllable count | count |

**Purpose:** These metrics provide context for all other calculations and help normalize scores across sessions of different lengths.

---

## 2. SPEAKING METRICS (Pace & Rhythm)

**Location:** `app/services/analysis/metrics.rb` (lines 86-105)

These metrics measure the speed and consistency of speech delivery:

### Words Per Minute (WPM)
- **Formula:** `words.length / (duration_ms / 60,000)`
- **Optimal Range:** 140-160 WPM
- **Acceptable Range:** 120-180 WPM
- **Categories:**
  - Too Slow: <120 WPM
  - Slow: 120-140 WPM
  - Optimal: 140-160 WPM
  - Fast: 160-180 WPM
  - Too Fast: >180 WPM

### Effective Words Per Minute
- **Formula:** `words.length / (speaking_time_ms / 60,000)`
- **Purpose:** WPM calculated only during speaking time (excludes pauses)
- **Use Case:** Identifies if slow pace is due to long pauses vs. slow articulation

### Speaking Rate Assessment
- **Type:** Categorical rating
- **Values:** too_slow, slow, optimal, fast, too_fast
- **Purpose:** Quick classification for coaching feedback

### Pace Consistency
- **Scale:** 0-100
- **Calculation:** Sliding window analysis (lines 501-529)
- **Method:** Measures stability using coefficient of variation
- **Interpretation:** Lower variation = higher consistency score
- **Target:** >80 for professional speaking

### Pace Variation Coefficient
- **Type:** Statistical measure
- **Purpose:** Quantifies pause duration variation
- **Method:** Coefficient of variation of pause intervals

### Speech-to-Silence Ratio
- **Formula:** `speaking_time_ms / silence_time_ms`
- **Purpose:** Indicates balance between talking and pausing
- **Interpretation:** Higher ratio = more continuous speech

---

## 3. CLARITY METRICS (Articulation & Pronunciation)

**Location:** `app/services/analysis/metrics.rb` (lines 107-135)

The clarity score is a **composite metric** combining six sub-components with weighted contributions:

### 3.1 FILLER WORD METRICS

**Location:** `app/services/analysis/metrics.rb` (lines 558-656)

Filler words are non-essential sounds or words that interrupt speech flow (um, uh, like, you know, etc.).

#### Detection Methods
1. **Primary:** AI-powered detection (most accurate)
2. **Fallback:** Language-specific regex patterns

#### Language-Specific Patterns

- 30-50: Moderate energy (conversational)
- 50-75: Good energy (engaging)
- 75-100: High energy (enthusiastic)

### Pace Variation Score (50-100)
