          <h2>3. AI Processing and Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            AI Talk Coach uses artificial intelligence to analyze your speech and provide feedback.
            It's important you understand how this works:
          </p>

          <h3>How AI Analyzes Your Speech</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Transcription:</strong> Your audio is sent to Deepgram (a speech-to-text service) to create a written transcript</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> The transcript and audio metadata are sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 model to analyze speech patterns</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback Generation:</strong> AI identifies areas for improvement and generates personalized coaching advice</li>
            <li><strong>Results Storage:</strong> Analysis results are stored in your account to track progress</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What Data Goes to AI Providers</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your audio recordings (sent to Deepgram for transcription)</li>

            <li>Session metadata (duration, language, practice scenario)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Your Recordings Are NOT Used for Training</h3>
          <p class="privacy-highlight">
            <strong>We want to be crystal clear:</strong> Your audio recordings and transcripts are NOT used to train
            AI models. Both Deepgram and OpenAI process your data solely to provide the Service to you, and they do
            not use your data to improve their models. This is guaranteed through our agreements with these providers.
          </p>

          <h3>AI Accuracy and Limitations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>AI feedback is for educational purposes only</li>
            <li>AI may occasionally produce inaccurate results</li>
            <li>AI is not a substitute for professional speech therapy or medical advice</li>
            <li>Always use your judgment when applying AI recommendations</li>

          <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal data:
          </p>

          <h3>Encryption</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>In transit:</strong> All data transmitted over HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
            <li><strong>At rest:</strong> Databases and file storage are encrypted</li>
            <li><strong>Passwords:</strong> Hashed using bcrypt (we never store plaintext passwords)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Authentication Security</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>JWT tokens:</strong> Secure token-based authentication</li>
            <li><strong>Token blacklisting:</strong> Revoked tokens are tracked and rejected</li>
            <li><strong>Password requirements:</strong> Minimum 6 characters (we recommend strong passwords)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Access Controls</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Limited employee access to personal data</li>
            <li>Access logging and monitoring</li>
            <li>Regular security audits</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Infrastructure Security</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Servers located in the European Union</li>
            <li><strong>DDoS protection:</strong> Rate limiting and attack prevention</li>
            <li><strong>Regular updates:</strong> Software and security patches applied promptly</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>No Security is Perfect</h3>
          <p class="privacy-note">
            While we use reasonable security measures, no method of transmission over the internet or
            electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.
            If you become aware of any security breach, please contact us immediately.

          <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>
            AI Talk Coach is based in the European Union (Portugal), and our servers are located in the EU.
            However, some of our service providers are located in the United States:

          <h3>EU to US Transfers</h3>

          </ul>

          <h3>Safeguards for EU Users</h3>

            When your data is transferred to the US, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):</strong> Approved by the European Commission</li>
            <li><strong>Contractual commitments:</strong> Our agreements with US providers include data protection obligations</li>
            <li><strong>Minimal data:</strong> We only transfer data necessary to provide the Service</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All transfers are encrypted</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Your Consent</h3>
          <p>
            By using AI Talk Coach, you consent to the transfer of your data to these third-party services
            for the purposes described in this policy. If you're in the EU and do not consent to these
            transfers, unfortunately you will not be able to use our Service, as these providers are
            essential to our AI-powered analysis.

          <h2>12. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer
            Privacy Act (CCPA):
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Know</h3>
          <p>You have the right to request:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Categories of personal information we collect</li>
            <li>Specific pieces of personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li>Categories of sources from which we collect data</li>
            <li>Business purposes for collecting data</li>
            <li>Categories of third parties with whom we share data</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Right to Delete</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain exceptions
            (e.g., completing transactions, legal compliance).
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Opt-Out of "Sale"</h3>
          <p class="privacy-highlight">
            <strong>We do NOT sell your personal information</strong> in the traditional sense (we don't sell
            data to advertisers for money). However, under CCPA's broad definition, sharing data with third
            parties like OpenAI and Deepgram might be considered a "sale."
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to opt out of this data sharing, please note that you will not be able to use our Service,
            as these AI providers are essential for speech analysis. If you still wish to opt out, contact us at
            <%= mail_to "zsottomayor@gmail.com" %>.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Correct</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information. You can update most
            information in your Account Settings, or contact us for assistance.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Voice recordings may be considered "sensitive personal information" under CCPA. We use voice recordings
            solely to provide the Service you requested (speech analysis and coaching). You can delete recordings
            at any time or configure automatic deletion in Privacy Settings.
          </p>

          <h3>Right to Non-Discrimination</h3>
          <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights. You will receive the same
            service and pricing regardless of whether you exercise these rights.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
          <p>
            To exercise any of these rights, contact us at:

          </p>

          <h3>Authorized Agents</h3>
          <p>
            You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. The agent must provide proof
            of authorization, and we may require you to verify your identity directly with us.
